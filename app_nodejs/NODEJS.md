## FrameWork
I decided to use Express production ready framework, because is minimalistic, asynchronous, fast, and powerful. You do not need to create heavy project for nothing, all web application is placed on 10 lines of code 

## Linter
I decided to use eslint linter for js, and use Airbnb code standart

This linter detecting both logical and stylistic lint. Usage of eslint linter:
npx eslint index.js


For Markdow I decided to use markdownlint as an extension in VSCode
